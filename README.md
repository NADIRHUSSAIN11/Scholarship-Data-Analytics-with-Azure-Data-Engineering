# Scholarship Data Analytics with Azure Data Engineering ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my latest project where I showcased my skills in data engineering and analytics! This project involved accessing data from three diverse sources - GitHub API, MS SQL Server, and an Amazon S3 bucket - using Azure Data Factory. The data was then seamlessly processed and stored in Azure Data Lake Gen 2, enabling a robust foundation for analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Utilized Azure Data Factory to fetch data from GitHub API, MS SQL Server, and Amazon S3 bucket.
  
2. **Data Storage**: Successfully sunk the extracted data into Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for centralized storage.

3. **Data Analysis**: Leveraged the power of Azure Databricks to conduct in-depth analysis on the Vivo Scholarship data, extracting valuable insights.

4. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Ensured a comprehensive data lifecycle by writing the analyzed results back into Azure Data Lake Gen 2.

5. **Visualization and Dashboarding**: Used Power BI Connector to create an interactive dashboard, providing a visual representation of the analyzed data.
